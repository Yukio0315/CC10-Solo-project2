## Overview
This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.
It is 2 and a half days project using Vue or React.

This is a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) project with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
It is kind of a quiz application which uses "[Open TRIVIA DATABASE](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)" and [firebase authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth).

## Resources
- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [firebase authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)
- [Open TRIVIA DATABASE](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

## Demo


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Future Plan
